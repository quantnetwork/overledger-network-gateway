The instructions below outline the steps to run an Overledger Network Gateway.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Public IP
- Ports 8080 and 11337 open
- BPI Key

## Getting Started
First, we need to run a local instance of MongoDB through Docker. Before we can do that, we need to create a Docker network for the two containers to be able to communicate:
```sh
docker network create ovl-net
```
```sh
docker run -d --name ovl-mongo --network ovl-net -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
```

## Running

We will now run a container based on the Docker image for the Overledger Network Gateway, passing in the relevant environment variables.

Make sure to replace the values for GATEWAY_ID with your BPI Key, and for GATEWAY_HOST with the Public IP of your machine.

```sh
docker run -dit \
    --name overledger-network-gateway \
    -p 8080:8080 -p 11337:11337 \
    -e GATEWAY_ID="bpiKey" \
    -e GATEWAY_HOST="127.0.0.1" \
    -e MONGO_DB_HOST="ovl-mongo" \
    quantnetwork/overledger-network-gateway:latest
```


After running the container, we can follow the logs using:
```sh
docker logs -f overledger-network-gateway
```

The Gateway will start up with a random number of connectors between C1 and C10.
Make sure when submitting requests that you submit them for the connectors that are up, as they toggle on and off on a scheduled basis. You can find the active connectors by checking the latest log entries.

## Running using docker compose

Make sure to replace the values for GATEWAY_ID with your BPI Key, and for GATEWAY_HOST with the Public IP of your machine
in the docker-compose.yaml file


Start the gateway with the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

After running the gateway, we can follow the logs using:
```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

Stop the gateway with the following command:

```sh
docker-compose down 
```







## API

We can now submit mock requests to our Gateway, using the /do-task API:
POST http://localhost:8080/tasks
with the body:
```json
{
	"connectorId": "C1",
	"task": "Send transaction."
}
```
